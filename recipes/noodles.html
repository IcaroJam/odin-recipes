			The chef's description:
		</h2>
		<p>
			<em>'This week, we're double-dipping in the world of Dan Harmon's lovable, irreverent collegiate caricature: Community. I'm here to defend the "weird" favorite food of Abed Nadir: buttered noodles. Yes, that impossibly plain side dish/cafeteria filler/thing you eat when you're sick. With a few simple tricks, we can upgrade this ubiquitous underdog into something worth making all on its own.'</em>

			Wow, thanks for that Andrew!
		</p>

		<h2>
			Ingredients:
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 box of high end supermarket pasta (I'd personally go for any Rana fresh pasta)</li>
			<li>gourmet butter</li>
			<li>kosher salt</li>
			<li>freshly ground pepper</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Preparation:</h2>
		<p>This is the recipe for the 15 minute version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGHTj4y_bd8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Binging with Babish's</a> video on this same recipe.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Start by bringing an oval-shaped dutch oven of slightly salted water to a boil and then add the high-end pasta. **Use slightly less water to make sure the water is extra starchy. </li>
			<li>Once the pasta is done, put aside about ½ cup of the water and then drain the pasta. Return it to the warm pot and do not rinse.</li>
			<li>Add 2 tablespoons of the unsalted gourmet butter,  ¼ cup of the pasta water, and a generous pinch of kosher salt.</li>
			<li>Give it all a rigorous stir until everything is completely dissolved and mixed together.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The result is a plate of pasta with a rich and creamy (emulsification lets goooo) sauce. The ease and simplicity of this dish gives it a special touch :)</p>
