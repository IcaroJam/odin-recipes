		<h2>
			What... in this?:
		</h2>
		<p>
			A (tipically) meaty delicatessen cooked in a crock pot by combining 2 <a href="https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Food" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">monster food</a> items, which include monster meat, monster jerky, durians <em>(wtf?)</em> and jellyfish. It takes 10 seconds to cook. Talk about flash-heated products.
		</p>

			'Tastes like <em><strong>hairs</strong> and meats with noodle.</em>'
